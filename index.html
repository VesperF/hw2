    <p>Jade is a unique and precious gemstone. It has a long history of ceremonial and ornamental usage in a variety of cultures. A symbol of high status and fine taste, jade art pieces have always been a favorite of royalties and art collectors.</p>

    <p>Today, jade remains to be a beloved gemstone in the Orient for its unique charm. The best jade is mostly excavated from Burma; the top quality jadeite (Imperial Green Jadeite) is valued on par with diamond.</p>

    <p>Different from diamond and other gemstones, the beauty of jade lies in its smooth surface, unique texture, and translucent color, expressing subdued elegance and timeless beauty. Jade is evaluated by its tone, translucency, and texture. <strong>The best jade has a penetrating vivid color, high translucency that shines through light, and a smooth surface with little irregularities</strong>.</p>
